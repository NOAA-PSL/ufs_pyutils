# Description
# -----------

#    This Singularity definition file builds a Singularity image
#    containing the following packages.

#    - AMD 64 CentOS 7 base Linux image;

#    - Docker Engine (https://docs.docker.com/engine/);

#    - GO programming language (https://go.dev/; required by Singularity);

#    - Singularity (https://sylabs.io/singularity/).

#    - Miniconda Python 3.9+ stack;

#    - ufs_pyutils applications.

# Singularity Instructions
# ------------------------

#    To build the respective Singularity image file (i.e., container),
#    do as follows.

#    user@host:$ singularity build el7_miniconda_ufs_pyutils_<TAG>.sif el7-miniconda-ufs_pyutils.def

#    user@host:$ singularity push el7_miniconda_ufs_pyutils_<TAG>.sif library://noaaufsrnr/noaaufsrnr/el7_miniconda_ufs_pyutils:<TAG>

#    In order to execute and application within the Singularity
#    container, do as follows.

#    user@host:$ singularity exec el7_miniconda_ufs_pyutils_<TAG>.sif <X> <Y>

#    where <X> is an executable or application within the Singularity
#    container (e.g., Python) and <Y> is an application exist on the
#    local host disk (i.e., a Python script/application).
