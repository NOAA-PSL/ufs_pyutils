# UFS Launch Applications



## Container Applications

The `ufs_pyutils` packages enables the building and deployment of
[Singularity](https://sylabs.io/singularity/) application
containers. The former capability allows a Singularity container image
to be established (i.e., built) on the host platform from an existing
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image. The latter allows a specified
Singularity container application to be launched within the
`ufs_pyutils` infrastructure.
